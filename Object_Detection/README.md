# Object Detection Project

---

## Dataset

This project uses the **COCO** dataset, which stands for Common Objects in Context. The dataset contains a large collection of images, annotated with object labels and bounding boxes. You can find more information about the COCO dataset at cocodataset.org.

## Model

The **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) v3 model is utilized for object detection in this project. YOLO is a popular real-time object detection algorithm that can detect multiple objects in an image simultaneously. The model has been pre-trained on the COCO dataset and is used for inference in this project.

## Implementation

| Steps | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| Step 1   | Importing libraries   |
| Step 2   | Loading the model (YOLO v3) pretrained on COCO dataset|
| Step 3   | Loading test images (4 test images have been used)  |
| Step 4   | Defining the function used for detecting objects in the test images  |
| Step 5   | Running the algorithm on the test images |
